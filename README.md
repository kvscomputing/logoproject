BIODS 253 Project #1: Logo Assignment
To run this file, you will need to install python on your computer, ideally using conda or some sort of package manager. 

Python comes with the turtle library pre-installed, so all you need to do is import the file (which is done for you in main.py).

The shapes.py file contains the functions that draw the shapes. Adjustments to the locations, sizing, and color of the files can all be made in main as the functions in shapes.py take in arguments. 

The main.py file contains a "if __name__ == "__main__":" statement that allows the code to be ran from the terminal. You can run this by navigating to the place where you cloned our repo and typing in your terminal "python3 main.py", and the graphics window should open up for turtle.

The test_shapes.py contains a test for all the core functions used in main.py. To run the code, first activate a conda enviroment using the env.yml file. "testdata" contains a House_final.png image used to compare the test image generated from test_shapes.py with the actual image.

Comments are added throughout the files, as well as a requirements.txt file that should explain the dependencies needed for this project. Please let us know if you have further questions!
