BIODS 253 Project #1: Logo Assignment
To run this file, you will need to install python on your computer, ideally using conda or some sort of package manager. 

Python comes with the turtle library pre-installed, so all you need to do is import the file (which is done for you in main.py).

The shapes.py file contains the functions that draw the shapes. Adjustments to the locations, sizing, and color of the files can all be made in main as the functions in shapes.py take in arguments.
